## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
  A mini game where the player has to in order to get a treasure inside. The game begins with the vault door closed.
  A random secret combination is logged in the browser console. The is a set of 3 pairs. Each pair is a number between 1 and 9 and a “clockwise”/ ”counterclockwise” direction. For example: “ 2 clockwise, 7 counterclockwise, 5 clockwise”. 1 means a displacement of 1 position, i.e. 60°. So 6 would be a full rotation of the handle.
  The player can interact with the handle of the safe. You can decide how the player interacts, i.e. by clicking on the left/right side of the safe, or by dragging the handle etc. Every interaction should cause the handle to react and rotate by 60° with animation. Upon repeating correctly the secret combination from the console - . 
  The door vault opens to the side and the treasure is revealed. There is a small glitter animation over the gold bars with a shine effect. 
  If the user makes an error entering the secret combination - the game resets. A new code is generated and the user has to start from the beginning. 
  Also, the vault handle “spins like crazy” several rotations.
